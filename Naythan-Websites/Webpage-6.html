<p> Summary: </p>
<l>    The second selection kicks into high gear. Isagi manages to reunite with Bachira, and together they challenge Rin Itoshi — the top player in Blue Lock — and his team. This stage is all about chemistry and evolution, forcing players to adapt or get eliminated. Isagi starts learning how to blend his awareness with others’ talents, while also pushing to surpass his limits. The matches get intense, and it’s clear that every decision, every goal, could decide who stays and who’s sent home. </l>
