<p> Summary: </p>
<l>    After Team Z’s dramatic win, the first selection ends — and only those who passed move on. Isagi and the others enter the next phase of Blue Lock, where the focus shifts from team survival to pure individual strength. They start the second selection, a stage that tests each player’s unique skills in one-on-one and small-group battles. Isagi reunites with rivals like Bachira and faces new, even stronger opponents. The pressure’s higher than ever — it’s no longer just about teamwork, but about proving who truly deserves to stay in Blue Lock. </l>
