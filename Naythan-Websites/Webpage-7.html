<p> Summary: </p>
<l>    Isagi and his team face off against Rin Itoshi’s squad in one of the most intense matches yet. Despite their teamwork and growth, Rin’s overwhelming skill and control of the game push them to their limits. In the end, Isagi’s team loses — but instead of giving up, Isagi chooses Rin to join his side for the next round, recognizing his strength and wanting to learn from him. This volume is all about ego, rivalry, and taking defeat as fuel to get stronger. </l>
